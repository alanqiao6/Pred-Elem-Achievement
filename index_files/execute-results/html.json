Socioeconomic status has been\nconsistently shown to influence academic success, specifically due to\ndiffering access to books, supportive services, and qualified teachers\nas well as due to exposure to adversity and parental distress. The\nstructural connections between race, socioecnomic status, and long-term\noutcomes makes racial minority status another potential variable of\ninterest. Along with socioeconomic status, parents' capacity to be\nhighly engaged and warm affects psychological health, which often\nunderpins academic trajectories. Thus, we seek to examine whether having\nboth, one, or no working parents affects reading skills. Finally, it is\nnecessary to explore the role of access to both family-based and\ncenter-based child care given the proven significance of high-quality\nchild care.\n\nCross-referencing research with our data to identify potential factors\n(most must be created using given variables):\n\n-   Community poverty level\n\n-   Percentage of community that belongs to minority racial status\n\n-   Percent of single-family households\n\n-   Percent of families where both parents work vs. where one parent\n    works\n\n-   Median cost of family-based childcare\n\n-   Median cost of center-based childcare\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Family poverty level \nmerged_data <- merged_data |>\n  mutate(family_poverty = pr_f)\n\n#Minority racial status \nmerged_data <- merged_data |> \n  mutate(\n    minority_racial_status = \n      one_race_b +\n      one_race_i +\n      one_race_a +\n      one_race_h +\n      one_race_other + \n      two_races\n  )\n\n#Percentage of single-mother households \nmerged_data <- merged_data |> \n  mutate(\n    percentage_single_mother =\n      h_under6_single_m / households\n  )\n  \n#Ratio of one-parent-working to two-parent-working households \nmerged_data <- merged_data |> \n  mutate(\n    one_parent_households = h_under6_f_work + h_under6_f_work, \n    ratio_of_one_to_both = one_parent_households / h_under6_both_work\n  )\n\n#Cost of center-based child care\nmerged_data <- merged_data |> \n  mutate(\n    average_center_child_care = \n    (mc_infant + mc_toddler + mc_preschool)/3\n  )\n\n#Cost of family-based child care \nmerged_data <- merged_data |> \n  mutate(\n    average_family_child_care = \n    (mfcc_infant + mfcc_toddler + mfcc_preschool)/3\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Conducting Forward Selection\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#filtering by year \nmerged_data_2018 <- merged_data |> \n  filter(study_year == \"2018\")\n\n#Creating regression model with all possible variables \nmerged_data_2018 <- merged_data_2018 |> \n  filter(!is.na(MN),\n         !is.na(family_poverty),\n         !is.na(percentage_single_mother),\n         !is.na(ratio_of_one_to_both),\n         !is.na(average_center_child_care),\n         !is.na(average_family_child_care),\n         !is.na(one_parent_households),\n         ratio_of_one_to_both != 'Inf') |>\n  mutate(\n   MN = as.numeric(MN)) \n\nmaximum_regression_model <- linear_reg() |>\n  fit(\n    MN ~ \n      family_poverty + \n      percentage_single_mother + \n      average_center_child_care + \n      average_family_child_care + \n      one_parent_households + \n      ratio_of_one_to_both, \n    data = merged_data_2018)\n\nregression_model_1 <- linear_reg() |> \n  fit(MN ~ family_poverty, data = merged_data_2018)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Preparing data\nbest_states_data <- merged_data_2018 |> \n  arrange(desc(MN)) |>\n  mutate(achievement_level = if_else(MN>=223, \"High\", \"Low\")) |>\n  filter(achievement_level == \"High\")\n\nbest_states_data <- best_states_data |>\n  relocate(state_name) |> \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(\"emp_m\", \"emp_service\", \"emp_sales\", \"emp_n\", \"emp_p\"), \n    names_to = \"sector_type\", \n    values_to = \"sector_percentage\"\n  ) |>\n  mutate(sector_type = case_when(\n    sector_type == \"emp_m\" ~ \"Management and Science\", \n    sector_type == \"emp_n\" ~ \"Natural Resources\", \n    sector_type == \"emp_p\" ~ \"Production\", \n    sector_type == \"emp_service\" ~ \"Public Service\",\n    sector_type == \"emp_sales\" ~ \"Sales and Office\"\n    ), \n    state_name = case_when(\n      state_name == \"Massachusetts\" ~ \"MA\", \n      state_name == \"New Hampshire\" ~ \"NH\",\n      state_name == \"New Jersey\" ~ \"NJ\",\n      state_name == \"Wyoming\" ~ \"WY\"\n    )\n  )\n\n#Grouping and summarizing data \nsummarized_data <- best_states_data |>\n  group_by(state_name, sector_type) |>\n  summarize(mean_percentage = mean(sector_percentage)) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'state_name'.

One salient learning objective of the program is to\ninstill passion and knowledge for remedying injustices in our nation's\neducational institutions. In this project, we seek to carry forward what\nwe have learned in our FOCUS and, through critical thinking, novel\nunderstandings of data visualization, and empathy, highlight\ndiscrepancies in academic achievement. Specifically, we will narrow in\non elementary school students across the United States, identifying\nenvironmental factors that contribute to inequities in their education. \n\n**Goals:**\n\nParticularly, the goals of our project are to 1) illustrate the relative\naverage 4th-grade reading level in each state; 2) provide a side-by-side\ncomparison of how much funding each state is allocating towards students\nrelative to each other; 3) utilize predictor pruning methods to\nconstruct a linear regression model with community-level factors that\nare associated with the average 4th-grade reading level across the\ncounty; and 4) determine the distribution of adults across various\noccupational fields in states with the best and worst 4th-grade reading\nlevels. Each goal corresponds to a visualization or regression model. \n\n**Data Overview:**\n\nTo achieve objectives, we integrated data from four datasets. The first\ndataset was `scores`, which had 6 variables and\n54 observations. The variables of interest were\n`state_name`, and `reading_level`, the average 4th-grade reading level\nin the given state in 2022. The second was `childcare_costs`, which had\n61 variables and 34567\nobservations. `Childcare_costs` offered all of our data on county-level\nsocioeconomic factors, and we mutated various variables to be potential\npredictors in our linear regression model for goal #3. The `counties`\ndataset had 4 variables and 3144\nobservations and was used to merge the country-based data in\n`childcare_costs` with the state-based data in `scores`. The\n`expenditures` dataset had 6 variables and\n23460 observations. From this dataset, we were\ninterested in examining `inf_adj_perchild`, or total government spending\non educational resources per child adjusted for inflation. \n\n**Findings:**\n\nVisualization #1 achieves goal #1 through a choropleth map, which is a\nmap that leverages differences in shading to denote the average value of\na variable in distinct geographic regions. We primarily employ the\n`geom_polygon()` tool to do so. The map illustrates that three states,\nFlorida, Wyoming, and Massachusetts, stood out among the rest for having\nsuperior demonstrated 4th-grade reading levels. To zoom out from this\nsuperlative factoid, it is also the case that smaller northeastern and a\nfew midwestern states have higher reading levels It may seem arbitrary\nthat these three states scored above the rest in terms of reading\nlevels, especially considering the diverse areas of the United States in\nwhich each of them is situated. However, consideration of principles\nlearned in the KISS class, Critical Race Theory in Education, proves\notherwise. Research into the breakdown of Florida's 4th grade reading\nlevels reveals one interesting notion: White students demonstrated\nconsistently high reading levels, second only to Asian students (who\nmake up a significant minority of the elementary population), whereas\ntheir other non-White counterparts scored lower, on average (\"The\nNation's...\"). Considering prior knowledge, the makeup of smaller\nnortheastern states like Massachusetts or New Jersey and midwestern\nstates like Wyoming or Colorado is also noteworthily White. Discussions\nin CRT have revealed the unfortunate truth that America's education\nsystems are upheld to be conducive to White students. According to the\nclass-provided article \"School Norms and Reforms, Critical Race Theory,\nand the Fairytale of Equitable Education,\" White students excel on\naptitude assessments like the SAT or IQ tests because they have been\ndesigned for them to do so. So, while there may be noteworthy additional\ncircumstances that foretell academic success, as we begin analyzing\npredictors of achievement, it is important to first recognize race's\ninterplay with soon-to-be considered factors in propelling a certain\ndemographic forward within American school systems. \n\nVisualization #2 fulfills goal #2 through another choropleth map. This\ntime, each state is shaded based on its `inf_adj_perchild`. A\nside-by-side comparison of visualization #1 and #2 allows for\npreliminary conclusions on the impact of public investments into youth\neducation and enables us to start identifying states that may have\nparticularly cost-effective educational systems. INSERT MAIN FINDING. \n\nOur [final_regression_model]{.underline} addresses goal #3. A\nfoundational literature review implicates several social, psychological,\nand economic in the development of reading skills in elementary\nschoolers. Socioeconomic status has been consistently shown to influence\nacademic success, specifically due to differing access to books,\nsupportive services, and qualified teachers as well as due to exposure\nto adversity and parental distress. The structural connections between\nrace, socioecnomic status, and long-term outcomes makes racial minority\nstatus another potential variable of interest. Along with socioeconomic\nstatus, parents' capacity to be highly engaged and sincerely warm\naffects psychological health, which often underpins academic\ntrajectories. Thus, we seek to examine whether having both, one, or no\nworking parents affects reading skills. Finally, it is necessary to\nexplore the role of access to both family-based and center-based child\ncare given the proven significance of high-quality child care. We\ncross-reference these findings with our data to create a number of\nvariables of interest. We constructed `family_poverty`, which was\nrenamed from `pr_f` and gives the poverty rate in the given county and\n`minority_racial_status`, which is the percent of the county population\nthat identifies as one minority racial identity or as biracial. We also\ndeveloped `percentage_single_mother`, which is the number of households\nwith single mothers, divided by the total number of `households`. We\ndesigned another variable for the ratio of households with one working\nparent to two working parents: `ratio_of_one_to_both`. By simply\nrenaming, we created `average_center_child_care` and\n`average_family_child_care`, the average cost of center-based and\nfamily-based child care, respectively, in the given county. We first\nengineered a maximum additive regression model with all the possible\npredictors, and then, we manually performed forward selection to\ndetermine what combination of the predictors yielded a model with the\nlowest adjusted R2. The models were sorted based on adjusted-R2 using\nthe XXX, which XXX. We find that XXX. \n\nVisualization #4 is rooted in goal #4. We have always been committed to\ncreating a visualization that zooms in on states with the highest values\nin `reading_level`. In our literature review to determine potential\ncommunity-level predictors for reading_level, we found that both\nsocioeconomic status and parental attitudes contribute to\n`reading_level`, both of which may be reflect in parents' occupations.\nThus, we opted to explore the average distribution of occupational\nfields of adults across all the counties in Massachusetts, New Jersey,\nNew Hampshire, and Wyoming, the states with the highest `reading_level`\nscores with inputted data for occupational percentages in\n`childcare_costs` in 2018--- the most recent year of data collection.\nThe original dataset included each occupational field as a separate\nvariable and gave the percentage of adults who worked in that field for\neach county. We then pivoted the data so that each there was one\nvariable for the names of the occupational fields, `sector_type`, and\nthe associated percentage in each occupational field,\n`sector_percentage`. This enabled us to construct a bar graph that\ndepicted the average percentage of the population that worked in each\nsector in each state. We find that in all four states of highest\n`reading_level`, the highest percentage of the population was employed\nin \"Management and Science.\" To go about explaining the distribution\nrepresented in this visualization, we drew upon the skill developed in\nthe Rethinking Schools class: self-reflection. As we each examined the\nindustries present in our hometowns, it becomes clear why there is a\ncorrelation between higher achievement and a high management and science\nmakeup. In Noah's hometown of Fairfax, Virginia, there is a large\npresence of government consulting firms and technology startups. He\nrecalls how the confluence of these industries catalyzed his school\ndistrict to become among the largest in the nation and found a magnet\nSTEM school, Thomas Jefferson HS, now ranked the fifth best high school\nin the nation. Another testament to this notion is how Anushka, being\nfrom Westchester, New York, grew up surrounded by leaders of finance,\nmedicine, and technology companies--no doubt making her school district\n(the 13th best in the country) what it is. Reflecting on some of our\npersonal upbringings ultimately speaks to the data-driven fact that high\nachievement is associated with specific industry, making this\nvisualization both personally and mathematically impactful.\n\n**Conclusion:**\\\nOverall, our conclusions illuminate opportunities for political and\nprogrammatic interventions. Visualization #1 identifies the states with\nthe highest scores in 4th-grade reading to be Massachusetts, Florida,\nand Wyoming. We subsequently determine that White students are\noverrepresented in these best-practice states. There is then an urgent\nneed to ensure that school's do not exclusively appeal to the\nintellectual and social tendencies associated with Whiteness. Future\nresearch should be conducted to test the efficacy and feasibility of\nnascent frameworks for multicultural education. Visualization #2 finds\nthat XXX. Visualization #3 finds XXX. Visualization #4\n\nOur analyses were restricted in a number of ways. First, since we only\nhad the average 4th-grade `reading_level` per state, we were not able to\ntake comprehensive advantage of the detailed data at the county level.\nWe could only look at the heterogeneity between states rather than the\nheterogeneity within states as well. Also, we could not examine\nlongitudinal trends; we only had scores from 2022, so we opted to use\ncommunity data from 2018, the most recent year of inputted data in\n`childcare_costs`, thus producing an arbitrary discrepancy with regard\nto time. Moreover, in the field of childhood education, standardized\ntests have persistently been delegitimized as they are not truly\nbaseline ways to measure aptitude, potential, and achievement when other\nconfounding variables such as disability or neurodiversity exist as we\nlearned in our other FOCUS classes. In light of these limitations,\nfuture research should determine predictors of academic success at the\ncounty level, which will facilitate more specific conclusions and data\npoints that can be used in the training of regression models.\nAdditionally, interactive visualizations can be pioneered to represent\nchanges in reading_level and corresponding predictors over time.\nResearch effort should also be made to replicate these analyses but with\na more holistic outcome measure, such as overall classroom functioning\nas reported by teachers.\n",
