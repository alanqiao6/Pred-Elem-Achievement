# Predicting and Analyzing Educational Achievement Among Elementary Students

This project was created by four undergraduate students participating in Duke University's Knowledge in the Service of Society FOCUS program. Its goals are as follows:

1. Illustrate the relative average 4th-grade reading level in each state
2. Provide a side-by-side comparison of how much funding each state is allocating towards students relative to each other
3. Utilize predictor pruning methods to construct a linear regression model with community-level factors that are associated with the average 4th-grade reading level across the county
4. Determine the distribution of adults across various occupational fields in states with the best 4th-grade reading levels
